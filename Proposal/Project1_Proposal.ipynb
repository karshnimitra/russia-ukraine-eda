The Russian invasion of Ukraine is one of the most horredous and evil acts we have seen this century. The Ukrainian people under the leadership of Preseident Zalensky have fought honorably and have united the West and NATO around their cause. As winter ends, both sides are predicted to begin fresh offensives or counter-offensives. For Russia the goal is to take more land and place the Ukrainians in a position where they will sue for peace and cede control of the Donbas. For the Ukrainians the goal is to liberarte their country. \n","\n","One of the few bright spots from this dark moment in history is the ability for data to be shared on the conflict in what is being called the first \"tik tok war\". Ukraines population has a strong tech sector and large amounts of public datasets have been made available as well as real time battle tracking through sites such as ua livemap. Great work on researching this topic by all of the major think tanks. Rand CSIS and AEI all have really great products that have helped the visualization of the war are updated daily and managed by a proffesional teams of data scientists and military experts. Which may beg the question is there still anaylsis that can be driven from publically available Ukraine data?\n","\n","We respond Yes. The work done by the institutuions such as CSIS, AEI, Brookings (links in the next section) are a public service and although we know we can't and shouldt attempt to match their work, we can look at some of the harder and less analzyed questions of the war. \n","\n","Turn on the TV and there is always a military expert hawking their own preconcieved notions of war onto the Russian Ukraine War on CNN or MSNBC. \"Tanks are dead, drones killed them\" \"The Ukrainian request for more tanks proves that tanks arent dead and we neeed more\" \"Drones are super effective\" \"Electronic Warfare has killed the drone and thats really the lesson of this war\" \"Warfare is purely Urban now\"\n","      - https://www.cnn.com/videos/world/2022/03/02/ukraine-john-spencer-russia-troop-sot-intl-hnk-vpx.cnn\n","      - https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=Tif3cpq51aw\n","\n","History may not repeat itself, but it does ryhme.

For simplicity we will break them down by the levels of warfare Strategic, Operational, and Tatical:\n","\n","1. Strategic:\n","  - Are NATO equipment packages significant and sending the right equipment to the Ukranians to help them win the war? \n","    - https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/western-military-aid-ukraine-russia/672737/\n","  - Are Russian deals with Iran and China going to help them replenish their dwindling reserves?  \n","    - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-02-08/g-7-mulls-sanctioning-chinese-other-firms-aiding-russia-s-military?leadSource=uverify%20wall\n","  - Can we quantify potential endings? Many experts are preditcing a slogging war of attrition, but Kremlin regime change, a Russian Army collapse, or Ukranian win are possible. The Ukrainians could lose if pressure from political forces at home end the supply of needed military aid. \n","    - https://www.rand.org/blog/2023/01/how-the-war-in-ukraine-could-end-sooner-than-expected.html\n","2. Operational:\n","  - Before the war swift victory by Russia was predicted by basically everyone. Why? Offensive warfare has been supreme since the United States won the Gulf War using a strategy called Air Land Battle.\n","  This concept has dominated warfare since then and has been the golden standard, but does it still hold? Does the data from Ukraine back this?\n","    - https://smallwarsjournal.com/jrnl/art/does-ukraine-spell-death-operational-level-offense\n","    - https://warontherocks.com/2022/08/ending-the-ideology-of-the-offense-part-i/\n","  - Hand in hand with the above question is the concept of attrition warfare. Is attrition back? This is bad news for all nations if true and terrible news for the Ukraininan people. \n","    - https://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/policymakers-keep-ukrainian-soldiers-front-of-mind-as-this-war-of-attrition-continues/\n","3. Tactical:\n","  - Are drones doing better than tanks?\n","    - https://www.bbc.com/news/world-62225830\n","    - https://www.businessinsider.com/ukraine-battlefield-like-world-war-i-but-with-terrifying-drones-2023-1\n","  - Is there evidence that Russia or Ukraine fights worse in urban terrain?\n","    - https://mwi.usma.edu/urban-operations-in-ukraine-size-ratios-and-the-principles-of-war/\n","\n","This is not an all encompassing list but a good starting point on somethings we can take away from the data.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"da2kiD2FjmVo"},"source":["# Possible Findings and Implications:\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OkzDAbEHkCk-"},"source":["Of the questions above the big finding that looks the most promising is a quantitative assessment that the offense-defese paradigm is shifting towards defense with the integration of new technologies on the battlefield. The implications of that would be that we have left the era of American military dominance through offense. Although bad for the American Military this could be even worse for the Chinese Communist Party who dreams of conquering Taiwan. Conquering Taiwan would involve one of the most difficult offensive operations in the history of warfare from a military that historically has struggled on offense. Hopefully analysis like this could help the international community increase its spending on Taiwanese defense, making them a prorcupine that deters the Chinese Communist Party from starting another bloody war on our shared planet. A strong defense may prevent war all together.\n","\n","The next big implication is can we quantate the involvement of drones and/or Russian countermeasures to drone in the war. Drones have highly changed the battlefield but most of the analysis on TV is on the tank vs drone debate where everyone digs into their entrenched beliefs. You can't where your tanker boots if the Army gets rid of tanks and Tankers love to wear their tanker boots. \n","\n","Finally what is the hard cost of a war of attrition? The world hasn't seen a war like this for a while, and they tend to destroy the economies of all involved. Russia predicted this war would end in 6 days. They are currently on a path that will ruin their economy and hopes for their grandchildren if they continue to fight this summer, let alone 2 or 5 years. All for a few square kilometers that they are currently destroying.
